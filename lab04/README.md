## Overview
In this notebook, I will analyze the Titanic dataset to predict fare by preparing/exploring the data, cleaning the data/handling missing values, performing feature engineering, and training machine learning models based on different selected features. More specifically, I will be using various regression models to provide insights on which features most impact fare price.

## Project Overview
### Section 1. Import and Inspect the Data

- 3.1 Choose features and target

### Section 4. Splitting
- 4.1 Basic train/test split
- 4.2 Train and evaluate linear regression models
- 4.3 Report performance

### Section 5. Compare Alternative Methods
- 5.1 Ridge Regression (L2 penalty)
- 5.2 Elastic Net (L1 + L2 combined)
- 5.3 Polynomial Regression
- 5.4 Visualize Polynomial Cubic Fit (for 1 input feature)
- 5.5 Compare All Models
  
### Section 6. Final Thoughts & Insights
