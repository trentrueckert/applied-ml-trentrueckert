## Overview
In this notebook, I will analyze the Titanic dataset to predict survival. We will inspect, explore, clean, and prepare the data for machine learning models. This process includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and performing data visualizations.

## Project Overview
### Section 1. Import and Inspect the Data
- 1.1 Load the dataset and display the first 10 rows.
- 1.2 Check for missing values and display summary statistics.
- 1.3 Check for correlations using only numeric features

### Section 2. Data Exploration and Preparation
- 2.1 Explore Data Patterns and Distributions
- 2.2 Handle Missing Values and Clean Data
- 2.3 Feature Engineering

### Section 3. Feature Selection and Justification
- 3.1 Choose features and target

### Section 4. Splitting
- 4.1 Basic train/test split
- 4.2 Stratified train/test split
- 4.3 Compare results
